    <h3 id="step-reconstructions">Step reconstructions</h3>

    <h4 id="passo">Passo</h4>
    <p>
      The <em class="foreign">passo</em> presents a basic problem for
      translation and reconstruction: It can be used as jargon,
      meaning a particular dance step called
      the <em class="foreign">passo</em>, and it can be used as an
      ordinary term meaning just a "step".  We have generally assumed
      rendered it as jargon unless it is clearly and obviously meant
      otherwise.  This is, of course, one possible source of error,
      but we think our choice to render it this way minimizes the
      chance of such mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than this one caveat, there isn't much information in the
      source exactly what is meant by the dance term,
      "<em class="foreign">passo</em>".  Some information becomes
      apparent from an analysis of timing
      (<a href="#step-timing">below</a>), but there is no information
      about the ornamentation or performance of this step in this
      manuscript.
    </p>

    <h4 id="passetto">Passetto</h4>
    <p>
      <em class="foreign">Passetti</em> are, obviously,
      smaller <em class="foreign">passi</em>.  They are usually done
      in sets of 4, and 4 <em class="foreign">passetti</em> on the
      part of the lady can move her from in line with the men, to
      forming a triangle with them - tautologically true, but if we
      presume a somewhat equilateral triangle, we get some notion of
      the amount of space covered. For one example thereof, see
      <a href="../translation/il-papa-09-la-primavera.html#8:15:4-5">la
        Primavera, leaf 8, page 15, lines 4-5</a>
    </p>

    <h4 id="passettino">Passettino</h4>
    <p>
      Other than being even smaller <em class="foreign">passi</em>
      than <em class="foreign">passetti</em> (obvious from the etymology>, there
      is no specific information about this step in the manuscript.
      We assume something like <em class="foreign">scorsi</em>
    </p>

    <h4 id="passo-falso">Passo falso</h4>
    <p>
      This step appears only
      in <a href="../translation/il-papa-14-baramattio.html">Baramattio</a>,
      and contains a pretty detailed description:
      <q>
        Then all together, they do a <em class="foreign">passo
          falso</em>, that is, a <em class="foreign">mezza ripresa</em>
        under the left foot, and a <em class="foreign">passo</em> on
        the right foot, which makes them turn their faces towards one
        another. (<a href="../translation/il-papa-14-baramattio.html#13:25:7-10">Baramattio,
          leaf 13, page 25, lines 7-10</a>)
      </q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that in section 4 of <i>Baramatio</i>, there are
      two <i>passi falsi</i> in a row, though there is no mention of
      which foot they are on that could aid the reconstruction.
    <p>
      Siena also has a <i>passo falso</i>, in <i>Ginevra</i>.  Most
      other versions of <i>Gienvera</i> have, at this point
      <q>
	They turn back with a <i>sempio</i> beginning with the left foot
      </q> [Smith, V. II, p. 131]
      though NYp has
      <q>
	They turn back with two <i>pasettini</i> begining with the
	right foot
      </q> [Our translation of Smith's transcription on the same
      page]
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="passo-in-traverso">Passo in traverso</h4>
    <p>
      We have a fair bit of evidence for this step:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-02-ippiter.html#3:6:22-23">Ippiter</a>,
          where in this manuscript, Giovannino says, <q>Then all three
            do three <em class="foreign">passi in traverso</em>, and the
            lady goes through their midst,...</q>, in Fl, the author
          has, <q>The lady passes through [his/its] middle and the men
            go to the side, they all go one against the other and they
            do three <em class="foreign">doppi della tangelosa</em>
            through the side</q> [Our translation of the original in
          Smith, Vol. II, p. 175].
        </li>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-01-la-vita.html#3:5:21-22">la
            Vita</a>, where in this manuscript, Giovannino says, <q>Then
            all three move and do three <em class="foreign">passi in
              traverso</em>, one by one.</q>, in NYp, Domenico and Giovano
          Ambroisio say, <q>They approache one another with
            three <em class="foreign">doppi portogallesi</em> beginning
            with the left foot, the woman passing through the
            middle.</q> [Smith, Vol. II, p. 297].
        </li>
        <li>
          Perhaps the most useful description comes
          in <a href="../translation/il-papa-12-lo-dimostra.html#11:22:12-15">lo
            Dimostra</a>, where it says, <q>But be warned that when they
            do the said <em class="foreign">passi in traverso</em>, and
            when in the <em class="foreign">passo</em> they do
            that <em class="foreign">ripresa</em>, in
            these <em class="foreign">passi</em>, they must do two of
            them, that is, one on the left side, and one on the right
            side.</q>  This implies both that
          a <em class="foreign">passo intraverso</em> normally
          contains a single <em class="foreign">ripresa</em>, and that
          it can (and in this case does) contain more than one.
        </li>
        <li>
		  They come in sets of 2 or 3 (or more - see la Villanella, line 
		  <a href="../translation/il-papa-13-la-villanella.html#12:23:13-15">12:23:13-15</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
		  Also in la Villanella, line 
		  <a href="../translation/il-papa-13-la-villanella.html#12:23:15-17">12:23:15-17</a>,
		  it specifies in a <em class="foreign">treccia</em> of
		  <em class="foreign">passi in traverso</em>, that one should start
		  each step using the opposite hand as foot - implying that which
		  foot one uses changes (and explicitly stating both are used, though
		  not explicitly stating that they are alternating).
		</li>
		<li>
		  However, in la Franciosetta, line
		  <a href="../translation/il-papa-11-la-franciosetta.html#9:18:12-17">9:18:12-17</a>,
		  there is a problem with strict foot alternation if this step doesn't switch feet.
		  However, it is worth noting that this may be an issue with the
		  <em class="foreign">volta di Tromboni</em> rather than with the
		  <em class="foreign">passo in traverso</em>.
		</li>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-10-la-reala.html#9:17:12-14">la
            Reale</a>, it states, <q>Then the lady alone moves, and does
            a <em class="foreign">passo in traverso</em> forwards, and
            with three <em class="foreign">passi</em> back, she returns
            whence she departed, and stops.</q>  This implies that
          a <em class="foreign">passo in traverso</em> covers the same
          distance as three <em class="foreign">passi</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Smith encounter the adjectival phrase, <em class="foreign">
            in traverso</em>, in Giove (Iupiter).  He notes <q>An
            alternative interpretation
            of <em class="foreign">traverso</em> might be "to the
            diagonal," or "to the side (but in the direction of
            travel)."  <em class="foreign">Traverso</em> =
            transvers.</q>. [Smith, Vol. II, p. 144, note 2
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In all, we take the passage from <em class="foreign">lo
        Dimostra</em> as fairly definitive, and use a simple
      reconstruction similar to a <em class="foreign">saltarelo
        tedescho</em> - three <em class="foreign">passi</em> forwards,
      and a step to the side - a <em class="foreign">mezza
        ripresa</em> This fits everything we have above - except that
      in <em class="foreign">lo Dimostra</em>, of course, there is a
      second step back, making the step almost like a cha-cha.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one counter-argument we would have against this
      reconstruction comes
      from <a href="../translation/il-papa-01-la-vita.html#3:5:10-12">la
        Vita</a>: <q>The woman then turns to him who is at her right
        hand, and they give right hands to each other and do
        three <em class="foreign">passi</em> with
        a <em class="foreign">ripresa</em>; end each returns to his
        place with another three <em class="foreign">passi</em>.</q>.
      In the same place, NYp says, <q>Then the woman takes the right
        hand of that man who is on the right side and they circle with
        two <em class="foreign">doppi gallopati</em> beginning with the
        left foot, each returning to one's place</q> [Smith, Vol. II,
      p. 296].  The timing with respect to the music and the parallel
      with NYp both seem to imply that the
      three-<em class="foreign">passi</em>/<em class="foreign">ripresa</em>
      sequences takes a single measure - the same time as
      a <em class="foreign">saltarello tedescho</em>.  Yet if one
      takes all the correspondences as literal and exact, the fact
      that NYp uses <em class="foreign">doppi gallopati</em> instead
      would imply a difference between the two.  However, taking all
      the correspondences as literal and exact would be a mistake -
      there are certainly differences between the versions, and a
      minor substitution of one double for another is certainly no
      larger a difference than others we see between the two versions.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ripresa">Ripresa</h4>
    <p>
      We get no specific direct information from this manuscript what
      a <em class="foreign">ripresa</em> is.  In fact, as we will
      discuss when we get to our <a href="#step-timing">timing</a>
      discussion, we suspect it is used somewhat inconsistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tend to perform this in much the same way as
      the <em class="foreign">riprese</em> from the repertoire
      of <em class="foreign">Domenico</em>
      and <em class="foreign">Ebreo</em>: two steps to the same side,
      leaving the weight such that one is ready to then go back the
      other direction.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ripresa-lunga">Ripresa lunga</h4>
    <p>
      This step only shows up once,
      in <a href="../translation/il-papa-04-non-mi-parto.html#5:9:15-16">Non
        mi parto</a>.  It means, literally, a
      "slow <em class="foreign">ripresa</em>", and we know little else
      besides that.  It might be an explicit reference to a full
      (two-step) <em class="foreign">ripresa</em> (as opposed to
      a <em class="foreign">mezza ripresa</em>), or it could be an
      otherwise normal <em class="foreign">ripresa</em> that takes
      more time than usual.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ripresa-under">Ripresa under [the left foot]</h4>
    <p>
      This step only shows up in
      <a href="../translation/il-papa-07-lucretia.html">Lucretia</a>
      All the source says is <q>... with
      the <em class="foreign">ripresa</em> under the left foot</q>.
      The previous step ends with the weight on the let, so we perform
      this by trying to end that previous step on the left toe, and
      just stepping left, with the right foot, passing the toe of the
      right foot under the heel of the left.  It's a very small step,
      and takes some practice to do with balance, and the evidence for
      the specifics is purely etymylogical - so take it for what it is
      worth.
    </p>

    <h4 id="mezza-ripresa">Mezza ripresa</h4>
    <p>
      Sources:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="../translation/il-papa-02-ippiter.html#3:6:18-19">Ippiter</a>,
          linked line and the line following:
          <q>... and a <em class="foreign">mezza ripresa</em> on the
            right foot.  Then they do two <em class="foreign">passi</em>
            forwards facing one another with the left foot,...</q>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="../translation/il-papa-12-lo-dimostra.html#10:20:7-8">lo
            Dimostra</a>, linked line and the line following:
          <q>And then he does a <em class="foreign">mezza ripresa</em>
            on the right side.  And then he does
            a <em class="foreign">doppio</em> turning to the left hand
            and one to the right hand</q>
        </li>
        <li>
          A <em class="foreign">mezza ripresa</em> is almost (but not
          completely> always part of a <em class="foreign">Volta di
            Lasso</em> (though not always labelled as such).
        </li>
      </ul>
      So from this we can derive that the step changes feet (assuming
      it is consistent).  We tend to perform it as merely a single
      step to the side, without a subsequent weight change.
    </p>

    <h4 id="reverenza">Reverenza</h4>
    <p>
      We get no detail about these.  We assume, given the existence of
      the paired <em class="foreign">reverenzette</em>, that this is
      roughly like the earlier <em class="foreign">reverenza</em> of
      Dominico and Ebreo.
    </p>

    <h4 id="reverenzetta">Reverenzetta</h4>
    <p>
      These always come in pairs, one forwards, one back.  We theorize
      that a pair of <em class="foreign">reverenzette</em> is a
      mid-way point between the <em class="foreign">reverenza</em> of
      the early Italian repertoire, and that of the later repertoire.

      We get no detail on these.  We perform them like
      the <em class="foreign">continenze</em> of the earlier
      repertoire of Domenico and Ebreo.
    </p>

    <h4 id="trapassino">Trapassino</h4>
    <p>We have a number of data points on <em class="foreign">trapassini</em>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em class="foreign">Treccie</em> always
          use <em class="foreign">trapassini</em>, in varying numbers,
          and involve individually covering a fair bit of ground -
          so <em class="foreign">trapassini</em> must cover
          ground.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-01-la-vita.html#3:5:24-25">la
            Vita</a>, where in this manuscript, Giovannino
          says, <q>Then follows the <em class="foreign">treccia</em>
            of eight <em class="foreign">trapassini</em> where each
            one returns to his place...</q>, in NyP, Domenico da
          Ferrara and Giovanni Ambrosio say, <q>They perform a
            "snake," the one weaving around the other with
            eight <em class="foreign">tempi</em>
            of <em class="foreign">piva</em> such that each returns to
            one's place</q> [author taken from: Smith, Vol. I, p. 197.
          Quote taken from: Smith, Vol. II, p. 298]
        </li>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-02-ippiter.html#3:6:24">Ippiter</a>,
          where in this manuscript, Giovannino says, <q>Then the two
            stop, and the lady alone does
            a <em class="foreign">trapassino</em>, and stops.</q>, in
          Fl, the author says, <q>Then the woman alone performs
            a <em class="foreign">tempo</em>
            of <em class="foreign">piva</em>, approaching them</q>
          [Smith, Vol. II p. 176]
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Siena version of Partita Crudele, it states,
          "<em class="foreign">et poi tre tempi de salterello col
          trapassino</em>" - "and then
          three <em class="foreign">tempi</em>
          of <em class="foreign">saltarello</em> with
          the <em class="foreign">trapassino</em>" [Smith, Vol. II,
          p. 231 - thanks to Vivian Stephens for the reference].  At
          this place in the dance, other manuscripts say (also
          according to Smith), "They perform
          three <em class="foreign">tempi</em>
          of <em class="foreign">saltarello</em> beating forward
          the <em class="foreign">tempo</em> of the two" - not a
          particularly clear description.  Vivan Stephens has, in her
          reconstruction of the dance, taken this confusing text to
          mean that the later two <em class="foreign">saltarelli</em>
          are ahead of the beat of the music - a reconstruction in
          which she has found some confirmation in music [private
          conversation].  We will also note:
          <ol>
            <li>
              There is a large gap in Siena relative to other versions
              of this dance following these instructions - so it may
              be a completely different version of the dance, or it
              may be a shortened form.  Smith describes the manuscript
              as "... often mere sketches of the required steps and
              action" [Smith, Vol. 1, p. 197], but the image he gives
              of the manuscript, on page 198, is hardly that of
              someone's quick notes - it is exceedingly neat and
              well-made.
            </li>
            <li>
              In this quote, "<em class="foreign">tempi</em>
              of <em class="foreign">saltarello</em>" seems to us to
              refer to muscial time signature, not to the step -
              otherwise, we would
              expect <em class="foreign">saltarello</em> to be plural.
              We are not, however, intimately familiar with this
              manuscript, so this could be something this author
              habitually does differently.
            </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, "<em class="foreign">trapassino</em>" is also
              in the singular.  Number (singular or plural) works
              differently in Romance languages than in English, so
              while the literal translation implying
              one <em class="foreign">trapassino</em> is possible, it
              is far from certain.
            </li>
            <li>
              One should also always keep in mind, for any given use
              of a step (especially an isolated term in a manuscript
              that otherwise does not use it - though see next note)
              that many terms that we tend to read as dance jargon may
              instead be used as everyday words.  However, have not
              yet found a definitive argument for a specific everyday
              non-jargon translation
              of <em class="foreign">trapassino</em>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          Overall, we find it difficult to get anything useful from
          this reference, and could probably use it somehow or another
          to support a host of contradictory hypotheses.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Siena version of Gratiosa, it says,
          "<em class="foreign">et poi si pigliano per mano dricta et
          fanno tre trapassi in volta</em>" - "and then they take one
          another by the right hand and do
          three <em class="foreign">trapassi</em> turning" [Smith,
          Vol. II, p. 164 - thanks again to Vivian Stephens for the
          reference].

          <p>
            Note that here it says
            "<em class="foreign">trapassi</em>", not
            "<em class="foreign">trapassini</em>" - though that
            probably makes little difference, it does leave our
            previous statement about the reference
            in <em class="foreign">Partita Crudele</em> being the only
            one in this manuscript as literally true, if probably
            factually shaky.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in all other cases so far, we have taken a
            diminutive to indicate a shortened form of the full step -
            it seems, for arguments of intellectual consistency and
            honesty, we should take the non-diminutive form here as
            indicating a longer version.  However, the other versions
            of this dance say to "circle with
            three <em class="foreign">tempi</em>
            of <em class="foreign">piva</em>" [Smith, Vol. II, also
            page 164].  This would seem to indicate that
            a <em class="foreign">trapassino</em> would be a
            fast <em class="foreign">piva</em>.  But
            a <em class="foreign">piva</em> is already the fastest
            step to begin with, so this is somewhat suspect.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would instead argue a slightly different usage between
            the Siena and the Il Papa manuscripts, or perhaps simply
            inconsistent usage in the Siena manuscript - two slightly
            different forms of the word, both meaning the same thing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The mere fact of a correspondence with other versions doesn't
      guarantee anything.  Note, for instance, that in measure 3
      of <a href="../translation/il-papa-02-ippiter.html#3:6:3-5">Ippiter</a>,
      where <em class="foreign">Il Papa</em> has
      4 <em class="foreign">passetti</em>, Fl has
      a <em class="foreign">dopio</em>.  It can't simply be argued
      that <em class="foreign">Il Papa</em> uses
      four <em class="foreign">passetti</em> in place
      of a <em class="foreign">dopio</em>, as it does
      use <em class="foreign">dopi</em> elsewhere.  However, three
      separate correspondences between the same two steps are more
      convincing. We therefore interpret
      a <em class="foreign">trapassino</em> as
      a <em class="foreign">piva</em> from the earlier repertoire
      (though we are somewhat afraid of confirmational bias in this
      decision).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em class="foreign">Trapassini</em> generally come in either
      even numbers, or in odd numbers followed by
      a <em class="foreign">passo</em>.  We take these two to be
      interchangable - when told to do an even number
      of <em class="foreign">trapassini</em>, we will generally take
      the last to be simply a <em class="foreign">passo</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      We should note that Smith
      suggests: <q><em class="foreign">Trapassini</em> is probably a
        variant term for <em class="foreign">contrapassi</em></q>
      [Smith, V. II, p. 203, note 4].  For all the above reasons, and
      the fact that <em class="foreign">trapassini</em> pretty clearly
      change feet, we doubt this interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is much less clear, there is also some link between
      the <em class="foreign">trapassino</em> and
      the <em class="foreign">spezzato</em> from the later Italian
      repertoire:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-04-non-mi-parto.html#5:9:14-15">Non
          mi parto</a>, the last figure states: <q>Then they go in a
          circle backing away from the other
          two <em class="foreign">passi</em>,
          one <em class="foreign">trapassino</em>, and
          three <em class="foreign">passi</em>.</q>  This looks very
          odd to us, in that it has a group of
          2 <em class="foreign">passi</em> and a group of 3, both in
          close proximity. Perhaps the music is just rather funky
          here, changing time signatures constantly.  But more likely
          is that the two <em class="foreign">passi</em> combine with
          the <em class="foreign">trapassino</em> to fit one length of
          music, while the last three <em class="foreign">passi</em>
          fit a second.  This juxtaposition looks a lot like
          a <em class="foreign">seguito spezzato</em> followed by
          a <em class="foreign">seguito ordinario</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-13-la-villanella.html#12:23:7-9">la
          Villanella</a>, we have: <q>Then all three do in a circle
          two <em class="foreign">passi</em> and
          a <em class="foreign">trapassino</em>, and they do this same
          thing together and in a circle, three times.</q> - pretty
          clearly three <em class="foreign">seguiti spezzati</em> in a
          row, and circling.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-07-lucretia.html#6:13:17-18">Lucretia</a>,
          we have the instruction: <q>Then all three take one another
          by the hand, and do three and a
          half <em class="foreign">passi</em> forwards, ....</q>  We
          are hard-pressed to come up with any legitimate
          interpretation for
          3&frac12; <em class="foreign">passi</em>; <em class="foreign">sequito
          spezzato</em> is the only viable interpretation we've come
          up with.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <a href="../translation/il-papa-10-la-reale.html#9:17:9-11">la
          Reale</a>, we again have the <em class="foreign">passo passo
          trapassino</em> sequence, followed by
          three <em class="foreign">passi</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one other similar reference that we have found in the
      early repertoire: again in NyP, at the start of the section for
      which there is no corresponding text in PnA, it says,
      "<em class="foreign">chon dua passi di natura e uno tenpo di
      piva e tre pasi di natura</em class="foreign">" [Smith, V. II,
      p.10 - again, thanks to Vivian Stephens for pointing us to this
      reference] - "with two <em class="foreign">passi di natura</em>
      and a <em class="foreign">tempo<em>
      of </em class="foreign">piva</em> and
      three <em class="foreign">passi di natura</em>".  So
      the <em class="foreign">Il Papa</em> manuscript would not be the
      only instance of this step pattern, but it does appear much more
      commonly there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Non of this indicates a close and clear tie between this
      manuscript and the dances of Carosso and Negri - at best, it's
      just a hint of a link.  But it's an intriguing hint.
    </p>

    <h4 id="volta">Volta</h4>
    <p>
      The <em class="foreign">volta</em> suffers from the same problem
      as the <em class="foreign">passo</em>, of being both a technical
      term, and a normal, everyday word.  However, in the case of
      the <em class="foreign">volta</em>, the choice matters more, as
      the timing of dances is altered based on which one chooses.  We
      have, therefore, done our best to translate the term when we
      think it is not a specific step - and this is a possible source
      of error, both in our translations and our reconstructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should also note that it is unclear if
      the <em class="foreign">volta</em> turns 180&deg; or 360&deg;,
      or if it is even consistent.  We have approached this question
      in our reconstructions on a case-by-case basis, without
      attempting a consistent interpretation across dances.
    </p>
	<p>
	  It seems generally that the <em class="foreign">volta</em> is
	  comprised of an even number of steps - either two or four,
	  presumably, not three.
	</p>

    <h4 id="volta-di-lasso">Volta di Lasso</h4>
    <p>
      A <em class="foreign">Volta di Lasso</em> seems to be
      two <em class="foreign">mezze riprese</em>, one left, one right,
      followed by a <em class="foreign">volta</em> 360&deg; over the
      right shoulder in two steps, all done in a single measure - it's
      fast!
    </p>
	<p>
	  Question for ourselves: do we know this is one left, one right?
	  Could it be two left?  That would make a certain consistency with
	  the <em class="foreign">volta di Tromboni</em>, which has three
	  quick <em class="foreign">meza riprese</em> to the left at the
	  start, and three more to the right at the end.
	</p>

    <h4 id="volta-di-tromboni">Volta di Tromboni</h4>
    <p>
      This always seems to be used as
      three <em class="foreign">riprese</em> to one side, then a
      volta.  It is always followed by
      three <em class="foreign">riprese</em> to the other side, but it
      is unclear whether those later <em class="foreign">riprese</em>
      are part of the step or not.
    </p>

    <h4 id="scempio">Scempio</h4>
    <p>
      What makes a <em class="foreign">scempio</em> differ from
      a <em class="foreign">passo</em>? Sadly, we find few clues to
      this vital question in this manuscript.  However (and
      see <a href="#step-timing">step timings</a>, below), it is usual
      that <em class="foreign">scempi</em> come in pairs,
      and <em class="foreign">passi</em> tend to come in odd numbers
      (noting the exceptions that
      precede <em class="foreign">trapassini</em> that we think
      indicate <em class="foreign">seguiti
        spezzati</em>, <a href="#trapassino">above</a>).
    </p>

    <h4 id="doppio">Doppio</h4>
    <p>
      While one assumes a <em class="foreign">doppio</em> means what it usually
        does, it's nice to get some confirmation:
        <q>
          ... and a <em class="foreign">doppio</em>, that is,
          three <em class="foreign">passi</em>
        </q>
        (<a href="../translation/il-papa-14-baramattio.html#13:25:12-13">Baramatio, leaf 13, page 25, lines 12-13</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it's probably not so simple as all that.  For
      instance, dances such as <a href="il-papa-01-la-vita.html">la
      Vita</a> have both <em class="foreign">doppi</em> and sequences
      of three <em class="foreign">passi</em>, in this dance existing
      in the same figure.  What is the difference between the two?
      Perhaps nothing - there are certainly instances in the
      manuscript of the author varying his choice of wording,
      seemingly solely for variety <!-- for those looking this
      closely, the particular instance we noticed was that, while most
      of the time, he will begin a phrase with something like "dipoi
      faccino", at he will occasionally reverse this to "faccino
      dipoi" --> - or perhaps there is a difference in timing about
      which we are told nothing.
    </p>

    <h3 id="step-timing">Step timings</h3>
    <p>
      At several points in the text, different people are doing
      different things at the same time.  This can, of course, be used
      to determine relative timing of steps (assuming they are used
      consistently).  Below are the 13 timing juxtapositions we found
