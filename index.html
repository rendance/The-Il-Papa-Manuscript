	<h1>The <em class="foreign">Il Papa</em> manuscript</h1>


	<h2>Background</h2>

	<p>
	  The <em class="foreign">Il Papa</em> manuscript is a manuscript
	  of uncertain date; According to the <a href="#nypl-ref">NYPL</a>
	  information, it seems to come from the collection of Walter
	  Toscannini, at least at some point, and he seems to have claimed
	  it's from around 1500.  But little about the manuscript is known
	  for certain.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Similarly the three dance authors mentioned in the
	  manuscript, <em class="foreign">il
	  Papa</em>, <em class="foreign">il Lanzino</em>,
	  and <em class="foreign">Giovannino</em> are of uncertain
	  providence.  While there is possibly a link between Giovanni
	  Ambrosio (the name Guglielmo Ebreo took after his
	  conversion <a href="#sparti-ref">[Sparti, p. 15]</a>) and the
	  Giovannino listed in this manuscript, Giovanni is an incredibly
	  common name, so we don't take this coincidence as all that
	  important.  Jennifer Neville mentions an early sixteenth century
	  dance master named <em class="foreign">Lanzo</em> who could
	  be <em class="foreign">il
	  Lanzino</em> <a href="#neville-ref">[Neville, p. 51]</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We can tell some things from context however.  We see many signs
	  in the steps in this manuscript that confirm that it lies
	  somewhere between those dances described by Domenico, Ebreo, and
	  Cornazano, and those described by Caroso, Negri, etc.  See our
	  step reconstructions for more details on this - but as a teaser,
	  we'll say right here, up front, there are a couple formerly
	  missing links in this manuscript between the two corpora.
	  Neville tells us the general community tends to think the
	  manuscript is from somewhere between 1500 and 1550, with David
	  Wilson claiming 1500-1525, and Barbara Sparti claiming
	  1515-1520 <a href="#neville-ref">[Neville, p. 51]</a>.
	  <!-- TODO: Check dates of Ebreo manuscripts in Smith, and of
	  earliest books/manuscripts from the 16th century repertoire,
	  interpolate. -->
	</p>

	<p>
	  Speaking of background, the background of this page is a tracing
	  of the watermark we found in the many blank pages at the end of
	  the manuscript.  We were surprised when we looked at the
	  original to see just how many blank pages there were at the end
	  (we knew of none, there were a lot).  These blank pages are in a
	  different gathering than the text of the dances - so it is
	  possible that the paper doesn't match (and we don't have a good
	  picture of the watermark on the pages with dance text).
	  Nevertheless, the watermark might provide a better clue than we
	  currently have for the date of the manuscript.  We therefore
	  have two pictures of the watermark for people to peruse
	  <a href="./watermark-1.jpg">here</a> and
	  <a href="./watermark-2.jpg">here</a> (pictures courtesy of the
	  Jerome Robbins Dance Division, The New York Public Library for
	  the Performing Arts). If anyone can locate information about
	  this watermark, especially including when and where it was used,
	  we would very much like to know.
