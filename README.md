# The Il Papa manuscript

This repository contains a transcription, translation, and set of
reconstructiongs of the Il Papa manuscript.  This manuscript
contains an introduction, and 15 dances by three authors, known
only as Giovannino, Il Lanzino, and Il Papa.  Two dances each are
assigned to Il Lanzino and Il Papa; the remaining 11 are assigned
to Giovannino.  The introduction is signed by Il Papa, hence the
common name of the manuscript.

The original manuscript is in
[the New York Public Library](https://www.nypl.org/node/33839)

One other thing we would like to put here front and center: the
watermarks drawn by Toscannini do not match those we saw in the
manuscript.  We have a few pictures we can show in person, taken
from the many blank pages at the end of the manuscript, that
show the real watermark relatively clearly.  We have traced this
watermark, and used it as the background of the introductory
page (or you can just click on watermark.png, above).  It is
composed of a cross above a rather crudely drawn
pegasus in a circle.  If anyone can find information about this
watermark, it might lead to a more exact dating of the
manuscript.  We would very much appreciate being notified of
any such information - though the most important people to tell
are probably at the NYPL.
